# Code-Samples
4 C++ Samples showcasing differnt aspects of my work in C++

## Ising Model
A small Ising Model implemented in C++ with a design document and a small test suite for various types of lattices.

## LAMMPS Fix 
This folder contains a LAMMPS fix that will fluidize elastic meshes by performing bonds flips. This code was originally written my Matt Peterson. Then completely rewritten, debugged, and optimized by me.

## LAMMPS Post Processor  
A custom Post Processor I wrote for LAMMPS to analyze experiments. This project makes use of POVRay for visualization.

## Shape Optimization
This is a GPU accelerated shape optimizer that will minimize the surface area of a shape for a given volume.
This was a prototype for the GPU accelerated code I contributed to Morpho.
